Matrix is a fullscreen editor for distraction-free editing of texts.
It provides you with the basic features any editor has (load, save, copy, paste, cut). More than that it doesn't do.
<p></p>
Alternatives to tis program are <a href="http://they.misled.us/dark-room"  title="Darkroom fullscreen editor">darkroom</a> and <a href="http://www.hogbaysoftware.com/product/writeroom"  title="WriteRoom fullscreen editor">WriteRoom</a>.
Both of these applications are fullscreen editors. WriteRoom is for Mac only, Darkroom is for Windows only. 
As for Linux there is an alternative approach <a hred="http://wiredearth-en.blogspot.com/2007/01/darkroom-deluxe-for-linux.html">here</a>
You may want to have a look at those three products.
<p></p>
Darkroom requires .NET 2.0 which is where my problems started....<br>
-I don't have .NET at every pc i work with, nor can i or do i want to install it everywhere.<br>
<br>
Writeroom is for Mac only which I don't have<br>
And the linux solution came after i started work on Matrix and frankly i don't like emacs.
<p></p>
Since i am still learning Python and such a thing is allways a good excercise i simply made it with Python.
<p></p>
The outcome i called "Matrix" in analogy to the computer-screens in the film. Matrix is a fullscreen editor, simple, easy, with no extra special features that nobody needs (well at least I don't). It loads and saves, allows to copy, paste,cut and change the font (size, color). I found the ability to go fullscreen very good. No other applications, task bars etc. to distract you.
Spellchecking and a way to call some external programs will be included in the next versions (i hope).
Personally i still need to start some structured text functionality.
