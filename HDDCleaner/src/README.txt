Price / Cost
The program IS free but does NOT come without "cost".
The price is at least one comment in this post about the program. I want to know who uses it, why and what he likes, dislikes, misses etc. So if you use it please do drop me a line.
And if you are so overwhelmed with this programs features that you really dont know how to say thanks (ok ... i am joking) then you can of course allways drop 5 bucks and make me happy the materialistic way as well.
